neurasthenic in Chinese is 神经衰弱，it first used by Americans in 1869,The term had been used at least as early as 1829 to label a mechanical weakness of the actual nerves .Neurasthenia is currently a diagnosis in the World Health Organization&#39;s International Classification of Diseases. However, it is no longer included as a diagnosis in the American Psychiatric Association&#39;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

the main symptoms is one will be very tired all day even he sleep more than 10 hours per day,can&#39;t focus on one thing longer than 10 min,fell fatigue with no reason,insomnia because think too much in the bed..

sounds terrible right, I&#39;m in this situation for about 3 years and just find it was a mental illness,I always thought I feel so stress(mental and physical) all day is because I sleep too late in night(abt 2AM) and wake up so early (some time 7AM,some 9am),but I do take snap during day ,1-4 hours maybe.then yesterday when I read a psychology book and found i&#39;m ill!!!

This could be good, &quot;the worst thing is you don&#39;t know you have a problem &quot;,,now I&#39;m ready to fight it!

this is my 1st day,the main treatment methods is SEE A DOCTOR,then MEDICINE ,combine them,I can be my own DOCTOR and can change my life style as medicine.

Since I know i feel tired is not because I sleep less,no need to sleep too much,when i fell tired at day time ,have coffee,this is my MEDICINE~~

About sleep well,I run every night so can get really tired,then drink milk every night,I find eat a lot (not eat a &quot;lot&quot;but eat &quot;a lot&quot;)helps with my sleep, I will feel hungry at midnight.

About concentrate on one thing~~working on it now,still got no way,still think a lot when really need to focus...
