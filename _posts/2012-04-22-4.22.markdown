4/22/2012 ,8:48pm ,sitting in my dormitory  ,face to the noisy notebook ,try to figure out how to spend the night.

Watched too much American movies

Although want to get myself a girl friend,just don&#39;t want go out.always try to tell myself :&quot;in a wrong place,you can&#39;t find the right person that could live your rest life with.&quot; why are so many Chinese girl aren&#39;t pretty ? they all seem too bitch or too dumb ,hate it .. starting like the American culture , there, one don&#39;t need to think about too much and can love freely.

one more year .I don&#39;t know where i would stay after one year

this afternoon ,i start to think sth about dream , After watching Randy pausch&#39;s The Last Lecture, I feel one&#39;s dream is really important, you should always work for it . I&#39;m planning do it !for my dream.
