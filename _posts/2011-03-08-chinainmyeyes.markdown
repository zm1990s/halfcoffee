> 2011 年发在 Opera 上的博客，英语写的，一是想锻炼下英语（现在看来很是蹩脚），二是想和老外交流，没想到后续还真的有越南人回应，每个国家都会有自己的小问题。现在回顾并翻译下。



每天身边都会有很多事情发生，想通过此博客记录下这些事情，以及记录一下对于这些事情的看法。





①

很多国人羞于谈性，这可能是受到传统文化的影响。在国内的中学里，很少能看到男孩女孩在一起接吻，因为学校不允许恋爱，父母也不允许恋爱。

在我看来，许多中国人羞于谈论性别。这可能受到中国悠久历史的影响。在中国的学校里，你可能不会看到一个女孩和一个男孩在中学接吻，因为学校不允许恋爱，他们的父母也不允许。

到了大学，父母会告诉他们努力学习，获得奖学金，考研等，但大学毕业后，许多父母就急于给他们的儿子或女儿找对象。

不像其他国家，中国人非常在乎你是不是处女。所以很多人可能直到结婚后才发生性行为。

很多人认为国内的性教育有很多问题，虽然在初中时教科书上有一些关于性的部分，但许多老师会跳过讲这部分，让学生自己学习。

我在初中之前对性一无所知。听起来很可悲。




②


中国人认为家庭比任何事情都重要，如果你工作后离开你的父母，这就是不孝，大家会看不起你。


上学期我学了一门名为“家庭学”的课程。老师说中国人更关心他们的家庭，而美国人更关心他们的夫妻。中国人认为父母很重要，你可以找到新的伴侣，但你的母亲只有一个。


更多的家庭关系可能会使人们更加依赖他人。在大学里，所有的费用都由父母支付。



③


如何学习，学习什么，学习后能做什么?


我想这可能是很多中国学生脑子中的问题。当然，这一切都是中式教育造成的。


高中时，一位数学老师给我们讲了一个故事：“许多年前，他去英国参加一个讲座，碰到一个中学生，于是问他:”98*345 等于多少？”，他以为男孩会用传统方式计算后再回答，没想到男孩拿出了计算器，输入 98\*345，然后告诉了他答案”。


在中国，这个男孩肯定会被称为笨蛋，不过我觉得这才是聪明的做法：这个男孩知道得到答案的最快方法。


说到学习，我们应该学习感兴趣的科目，而不是未来适合工作的科目。另外，学习是为了将这些知识运用起来，比如大部分人可能都用不到英语，那学习英语的作用何在。第三，我们不是科研人员，我们只需要知道如何使用一个东西，而不是如何制造它。（这段已经忘记当时想表达什么了，现在看来，有些...）

中国缺乏发明家，我认为这都是因为中国的教育制度。学习使人成为学习机器，而不是有自己思想的人。




④


接着，中国太拥挤了。

中国是一个大国，许多农民不能仅仅依靠种植庄稼来养活家庭，所以他们大多去其他地方做生意或打工，一些妇女则去当阿姨照顾小孩。城市里的人口变得很庞大，到哪里都可以看到人。

春节是中国最大的节日，无论人在哪里工作，过年的时候一般都会回家。这会导致交通问题，在这段时间里，很多人会买不到火车票。


如果你有幸买到了票，下一个面临的问题便是“拥挤”。你必须花两个小时等火车，否则你可能会错过火车，因为你挤不上火车。


在旅途中，你最好不要吃也不要喝。因为火车上挤满了人，很难去洗手间。

如果仔细观察，你会发现人其实并不多，但是包裹太多了。每人至少带一两个大箱子。有些人的包裹比人还大。我讨厌这样子的状态。我认为回家完全没有必要带那么多东西。大多数包裹是食物和衣服。那些东西既不贵也不实用。当我出去的时候，我可能只带一些钱，一支笔，一个笔记本，一两件衣服。我不想让我的旅行太累。




⑤


我喜欢电脑。我大部分时间都花在这上面。我曾经梦想成为一名黑客（Cracker），但现在不这么觉得了，我讨厌那些偷别人密码，窃取别人信息的人。中国有很多黑客。他们的工作就是攻击别人的电脑或传播电脑病毒。有一次我被病毒攻击了，所以不得不重新安装所有的软件。真是不想再经历这种事。

大多数中国人使用 Windows 操作系统，但大多数操作系统都是盗版，而且很多人不买杀毒软件，他们想要免费的。

我过去用 Windows，但现在用 Linux，它比 Windows 更快、更安全。我听说大多数中国人不使用 Linux，因为他们认为 Linux 很难用。这只是个表面上的问题。最大的原因是越来越少的中国公司支持 Linux。比如 QQ，QQ 是一款在中国非常受欢迎的即时通讯软件，但它只能在 Mac 或 Windows 上使用。

在中国，几乎每所中学都教学生如何使用 Windows，而不是 Linux。他们用盗版的东西却教学生不要抄袭，多么讽刺啊!



一位越南网友的回复：

> (哇！真艰难，中国人的生活方式比越南要艰难得多。同样的事情也会发生在越南，但人们有更多自己的选择。我们以前也羞于谈论性。事实上，学校不愿意让学生掌握最基本的安全和健康的性知识。与西方人不同，东方人羞于谈论这个问题，父母和孩子很难找到舒适的方式来公开系统地讨论这个问题。但我猜，这种趋势在逐渐向西方转变，或者我所看到的只是社会退化的一个不方便的事实。父母总是告诉他们的孩子在上大学之前不要和任何人谈恋爱。学校不鼓励学生做出一些违背传统的行为——拥抱、亲吻或任何亲密的动作。然而，他们中的一些人无视这些警告，像他们在电影中看到的那样行事，就像他们想向全世界展示他们正在实践自己的爱和恋爱的权利，而不顾别人的建议和警告。有些人知道自己爱上了别人，却设法隐藏自己的感情。
>
>
> 就像你说的，当他们的孩子从大学毕业时，父母敦促他们有一个家庭，这样他们就会有孙子或孙女。太有趣了。贞操是男人评判女人时最关心的问题之一。世界上发生过许多悲惨的故事，只是因为童贞问题而导致遗憾的结果。
>
>
> 我们也被教导，我们应该尊重和关心家庭，尤其是我们的父母，而不是其他人，甚至是我们的妻子或女朋友。的确，我们只有一个爸爸和一个妈妈。伴侣在家庭这个话题下是不值得一提的，因为不具唯一性。哈哈。
>
>
> 大多数学生进入大学后不得不依靠父母支付学费，因为他们很难找到兼职工作来支付他们的生活和大学学费。
>
>
> 在越南，学校通常让学生不依赖计算器或其他工具来做数学。据说，通过这样的头脑风暴，可以锻炼学生的大脑和思维方式。在以前，计算器对于老师和学生来说都过于奢侈，所以他们不得不用传统的方法来计算数学。但是现在，计算器已经变得无处不在，学生们会认为用计算器做数学很聪明。哈哈
>
> 说到教育，我们的教育体系效率低下，需要改进。我们在选择专业时有更多的选择。几乎每个学生都选择热门专业，这可以使他们毕业后能找到赚钱的工作或职位。
>
> 还有更多（类似的问题）。要把它们列出来要花很长时间。我们所看到的已经深深扎根于社会，很难改变。即使有可能改变，唯一剩下的问题是时间。50年后，或者 100 年后？



> 生活在发展中国家挺艰难的，我们必须学习很多难的东西才能取得好成绩，找到一份好工作。
>
>
> 去年，我选择了学习信息工程，但是现在我发现它太难了，我不觉得未来工作中可以用到这些知识 :( :(



> 这里也一样。我只想离开这个国家。只想住在美国、英国和欧洲等发达国家。学生所学的大部分专业对未来的工作没有实际用处；我们所学的几乎与工作要求无关。唯一能给雇主留下好印象的就是英语。比较讽刺的是，当我们申请工作时，外语是一个有效的手段。越南的雇主更关心员工的语言水平，而非大学成绩。我正在学习法律，但我想成为一名商人而不是律师。
>
> 一切又奇怪又有趣。天，我们国家和你们国家一样，一切都很混乱。



> 我感觉你的的英语水平一定很好。



> 谢谢。英语是我对未来唯一的希望，也是我花大部分时间用心学习的唯一的东西。

以下是英文原文。



I born in china ,and I grow up in China.every day I saw  many things happens.I write this blog to record some things happen to me,and how do I feel about those.

English is my second language ,so i may make some mistakes in grammar or vocabulary.

①

In my eyes,many Chinese ashamed to talk about sexes.this may affected by China&#39;s long history . In china&#39;s school,you may not see a girl and a boy kiss each other during hole middle school , because school are not allowed love , neither do their parents .

when many students are in universities ,their parents may not allowed  their child love and tell them to study hard and get scholarship or get Postgraduate degree . but after university ,many parents are urge to find a mate for their son or daughter.

unlike other country ,Chinese very care you are a virgin or not . so many people may not have sex until they get married.<br/>I think china&#39;s Sexual education have many problems .Although in junior high school, textbooks have some parts about the sexes , many teachers skip these parts and let students study by themselves.

I know noting about sexes before Junior high school .Sounds pathetic.



②

Chinese people think family is more important than any other thing ,if you leave your parents alone after you work ,you are not filial,then people will look down on you .

Last semester  I learned a subject named Family . The teacher said that Chinese people are more care about their family while Americans are more care about their couples . Chinese think parents is important , you can find a new couple but you can&#39;t have another mother.

More Family relationships may made people more rely on other people. In college ,all the costs paid by parents.

③

How to study ,study what, what you can do after study? 

I think it may be problems for many Chinese students.Of course it made by China education system.

During high school ,A math teacher told us a story:&quot;many years ago ,he went to UK attend a lecture,he meet a middle school and asked him a question:98*345=? ,he thought the boy may tell him the answer after calculation,but  the boy use a calculator and then give him the answer &quot;.

In china , the boy must be called idiot ,but I think it&#39;s smart. The boy knows the fast way to get the answer.

Saying studies,we must study the subject we interested in ,not subject can make us rich.Then we study things is to use them ,English is only important for those who need to use it,not for everyone. third, we aren&#39;t researchers ,we just need to know how to use a thing not how to make it.

China is lack of Inventor , I think it all cause by China education system.study make student a study machine not a person with his own mind.

④

then ,China is too crowded .

China is a big country , many farmers can&#39;t live just rely on planting crops. so they most go to other place make business or do some heavy works.some women become baby sister .So,Urban population become big. you can see people any where any time.

 &quot;nian&quot; is the biggest festival in China .so everyone will go home wherever they are. this can cause traffic problems.During those days,many people can&#39;t buy train ticket. 

If you got a ticket. the next biggest problems is “crowded”. you must take two hours waiting the train,or you might miss your train because you can&#39;t get in the train in that crowded. 

During the trip ,you had better not eat or drink.because train full of people you can&#39;t go to bathroom.

If you look carefully,you may found there aren&#39;t too people but there are too many packages. Every one at take least one or two big suitcase. Someone&#39;s packages are bigger than a man . I hate them. I think it&#39;s completely no need to take so much things when go home. Most packages are food and clothes.  Those things aren&#39;t expensive nor  useful . When I go out , I may just take some money ,a pen,a notebook ,one or two clothes. I don&#39;t want my trip too tired.

⑤

I like computers. I spend most of my time on it .  I used to dream to be a hacker. But now I thought it was too bad. I hate peoples who stolen others passwords and make lost of one&#39;s informations . China has lots of  hackers . Their work is attack others&#39; computer or spread computer virus . Once I was attacked by virus so I had to reinstall all of software . Now it can&#39;t happen again , I guess .

I know most Chinese people use windows operating system. But most of these OS are piracy. And many people won&#39;t buy antivirus software , they want free.

I used to use windows,but now I&#39;m using Linux. It&#39;s more quickly and more safe than windows. I heard most Chinese people won&#39;t use Linux because they thought it&#39;s hard to use them . It&#39;s a problem in face. The biggest reason is less Chinese company support it . Like QQ,a very welcomed IM software in China ,it can only use in mac or windows. 

In china ,almost every middle school all teach students how to use windows not Linux . They use piracy things teach students not plagiarize . How ironic！

越南网友的回应：

> [Wow! That&#39;s strict and Chinese people&#39;s way of life is way harder than that in Vietnam. Same things happen in Vietnam but people have more choices of their own. We used to be ashamed to talk about sex too. In fact, schools are reluctant to equip their students with the least knowledge about safe and healthy sex. Unlike the Western, Oriental people feel shy to talk about it, even parents and their children hardly can find any comfort to discuss this issue openly and constructively. But I guess that trend has been shifting toward the Western one or what I have seen is just an inconvenient fact of social degradation. Parents always tell their children not to fall in love with anybody until they get into universities. Schools do not encourage students to perform behaviors - hugging, kissing or any intimate gesture - that are somewhat contrast to tradition. Still, some of them defy those warnings and act like what they see in movies just like they want to show the whole world that they are practicing their right to love and have relationships regardless of advices and warnings from others. Some manage to hide their feelings when they know they have fallen in love with someone else. 
>
> Just like you say, when their children graduate from universities, parents urge them to have a family so that they will have a grandson or granddaughter. It&#39;s so funny. Virginity is one of the biggest concern here for a man judging  a woman. There happened many tragic stories which led to regretful results just because of virginity matter.
>
> 
>
> We are also taught that we should respect and care about family, especially our parents, more than anyone else, even our wife or girlfriend. It&#39;s true that we only have one dad and one mom. Girls are out of the question since there are many out there for us to choose. lol.
>
> Most of the students when they get into college have to rely on parents to pay their tuition as it&#39;s hard for them to find part-time job which gives then sufficient salary to afford their life as well as college tuition.
>
> In Vietnam, students are advised to do maths on their own without help from calculator or modern tools. It is said that by brainstorming they can sharpen their mind and way of thinking. There were times when a calculator was too luxurious for a anyone to have, teachers as well as students had to do the maths by conventional methods. But now, calculators have become so ubiquitous and students would think it&#39;s smart and best to use calculators for math. lol.
>
> Talking about education, our educational system is way ineffective and needs improving. We have more options in choosing the subject. Almost every students pick up hot major which enables them to have lucrative job or position after graduation. And many more. It will take forever to list them down. What we see has been rooted deeply in society and it&#39;s hard to change it. Even if change is possible, the only matter left is time. 50 years may 100 years later.



我：

> it&#39;s hard to live in developing country ,we have to study a lot difficult things to get a good grade and find a good job.
>
> last year ,I choose to study Information Engineering ，but now I find it&#39;s too difficult to study,I don&#39;t think it can be used in future work  :( :(



> The same here too. I just want to go away from this country. Just want to live abroad in developed countries like US, UK and Europe ones. Most of the majors students study have no practical use for future work; what we are taught hardly bear relevance to job requirements. The only think that helps them make impression on employers is English. Ironically, foreign language is an effective and ultimate tool when we apply for a job. Employers in Vietnam concern more about the employees&#39; language level than their college score reports. <br/>I&#39;m studying law but want to be a businessman rather than a lawyer. So weird and Funny. Man. Everything is in chaos in my country as well as in yours.



> I think your English must be very good:)



> Thanks. English is my only hope for the future and the only thing I invest most of my time studying with the best intention.
